# I should code more

This extension is for all the procrastinators out there who just can't help themselves when it comes to addictive websites like YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, Netflix, and all the other dopamine dispensers.

It's a simple extension that will redirect you from those websites to your favorite Spotify playlist. It's like a digital slap on the wrist, but in a nice, non-judgy way.

It's not meant to be a productivity hack (although it might help). It's more of a reminder that you should probably be coding instead of watching cat videos.

The extension is still in its infancy, and I'm open to any suggestions or feature requests. But for now, it should do the trick.

If you want to contribute or file a bug report, let me know in issues or add pull request.

Cheers.
